#Basics Of C++ Programming
    - Syntax, library/header file
    - cin, cout, <<, >>
    - endl, '\n' - new line character
    -! `;` is important
    - to compile --> `g++ filename.cpp -o run`
    - to run --> `./run`

# Datatypes
    - int, float, double, char, string, bool
    - sizeof() - to get the size of the datatype
    - garbage value
    -
    - How datatypes are store in the memory
        - Decimal to Binary
        - 1's Complement
        - 2's Complement
    - How +ve and -ve numbers are stored
    - how char datatype is stored
    - minimum memory allocation for any datatype is 1 byte

# Operators
    - Arithmetic Operators --> +, -, *, /, %
    - Relational Operators --> ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
    - Assignment Operators --> =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=
    - Logical Operators --> &&, ||, !
    - Bitwise Operators --> &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>

    OOPs - object oriented programming system.
